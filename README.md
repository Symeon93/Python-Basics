# Python-Basics

The particular repository is a result of the course I took with Codecademy "Python for Data Science" 
to learn the fundamentals of Python needed to get started with Data Science and Data Analytics.

The material includes learning the basic data structures (integers, floats, strings booleans), containers
of the basic structures (lists, tuples,sets, dictionaries) and their characteristics (immutability/mutability, 
duplicate values/non duplicate values) as well as the methods used to manage data within containers
(append(), pop(), extend(), insert() etc).  

The rest of the learning material includes flow control, conditionals, functions and more advanced concepts
like OOP and decorators.
